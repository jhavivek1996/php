Once a file is opened using fopen() function it can be read with a function called fread(). This function requires two arguments. These must be the file pointer and the length of the file expressed in bytes.

The files length can be found using the filesize() function which takes the file name as its argument and returns the size of the file expressed in bytes.

So here are the steps required to read a file with PHP.

Open a file using fopen() function.

Get the file's length using filesize() function.

Read the file's content using fread() function.

Close the file with fclose() function.
